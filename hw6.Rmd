# Directions
Please submit \textbf{ONE PDF} file including all your reports (answer + code + figures + comments; must be easily readable and have file size under a few megabytes) and \textbf{ONE R code script}. The R script is supplementary material to ensure that your code runs correctly. If you are using RMarkdown, please also include your \texttt{.Rmd} file. If using Python, please submit the Python notebook in lieu of the R script.
Place these two (or three) files in a folder, make a zip or rar archive, and submit the archive electronically via Dropbox file request  at \texttt{\url{www.tinyurl.com/nbliznyuk-submit-files}}
(on the landing page, enter your name so that we know it is you and email so that you get a confirmation).
Please submit only ONE solution on behalf of the entire work group, NOT separate solutions by different group members. You can have multiple submissions, in which case only the most recent will be graded.
\textbf{Deadline:} 21-Oct-2025 (Tuesday), 21:00 EST.
